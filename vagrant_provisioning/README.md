# Vagrant and VM Provisioning

Provisioning is derived from providing / supplying something. E.g. provisionining for food or water. 

In this context it will be providing our machines with instructions, variables, files and folders. 

This will mean we can set up a machine to a specific state when turned on. 

## gem and bundler vs PIP and packages 
- Gems are packages in ruby or dependencies
- bundler is ruby's package manager
- To install gems from Genfile, you run:
`bundle install`
 ## Ruby's testing framework is rspec
 - rspec needs to be installed 
 ## JS package manager is npm (node package manager)
 - npm packages
 - after version 6 comes pre loaded with NPM

 ## Ubuntu package manager : `apt`
 - apt-get
 - mostly depreciated now

 ## installing test
 1. to the dolfer with femfile
 2. run `bundle`

 ## running test : `rake spec`
