## What is DevOps?
```
DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.

## Why DevOps - benefits to the business

### Technical Benifits:
- Continious Delivery
- Faster resolution to problems 
- Transparent and Agile way of working

### Cultural Benifits:
- Better communication between ops and devs
- Greater professional development opportunities (less focused on specialisation)

### Business Benifits:
- Faster delivery of features
- More stable and sustainable operating environments
- Improved communication and collaboration 
- More time to innovate, rather than fix/ maintain, due to automated checks ensuring issues aren't brought forward to the customer.

## Tools of DevOps

There are many DevOps tools, some of the key ones are described below:

1. Docker

![Docker](https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/05/08/af178c5a-64dd-4900-8447-3abd739757e3/resize/770xauto/78abd09a8d41c182a28118ac0465c914/docker-vm-container.png)

[Source](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-docker-and-why-is-it-so-darn-popular/)

Docker is an open-source platform that focuses on containers. It allows developers to package an application and all its dependancies. For example, you can run (and test!!!!) an application which requires python, without having python installed, let alone its latest version. 

2. Ansible

```
Ansible is an open source IT Configuration Management, Deployment & Orchestration tool. It aims to provide large productivity gains to a wide variety of automation challenges. This tool is very simple to use yet powerful enough to automate complex multi-tier IT application environments.
```

Ansible is used to automate security and compliance, application deployment, configuration management and provisioning as well as other things. It can be used by people with no experience of coding. 

3. GitHub

GitHub is used for project management and version control. Using git, you can revert to previous versions of your software, making it easy to spot and fix mistakes and 'fool-proof' for team projects. It is open source and free.

## Cloud Computing

```
Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. `
```
[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)

Using Cloud Computer, you can rent the processing power and storage of other computers and have this data securely stored in a protected server. The most popular cloud computing provider is Amazon, who provide 'AWS', a term which stands for 'Amazon Web Services' but has become synonymous with Cloud Computing. 

## What is SAAS, PAAS, IAAS
![S/P/IAAS](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/cvt-66fe07eb57d3b8a1e4d0dacf7e02389f459c256663e42bd7bc59d9a82dc34884/images/page/overview/what-is-iaas/what-is-iaas.png)

### SAAS

```
Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internetâ€”as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.
```

### PAAS

Similar to SAAS, PAAS is Platform as Service, which is the ability to rent a development and deployment environment in the cloud. This allows you to avoid paying for software licences etc, installations etc and instead rent on a by-need basis. 


### IAAS

IAAS stands for 'Infastructure as Service' and allows the user to use servers, storage and other infastructure on a need-basis without requiring an upfront investment. 

## When should we use PAAS, IAAS, SAAS and why

- When we want to reduce upfront investment 
- When a project's storage and processing requirements are unclear
- when there is a possibilty of a project being discontinued, and it is unclear whether a large investment in sof/hardware would lead to a positive ROI.

**We use it to mitigate risks associated with starting a new project.**

## What do we mean by on prem/localhost - Hybrid and public cloud

### perm/localhost

On-premise computer, or a localhost is to install your own physical servers and related infrastructure needed to run it and develop the plataforms, application and services you need. 

'Localhost' is server ran by your computer. 

### Hybrid Cloud`

```
Hybrid cloud is a solution that combines a private cloud with one or more public cloud services, with proprietary software enabling communication between each distinct service. A hybrid cloud strategy provides businesses with greater flexibility by moving workloads between cloud solutions as needs and costs fluctuate.
```

### Public Cloud

```
The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free of charge or sold on demand, allowing customers to only pay per usage for the CPU cycles, storage or bandwidth they consume.
